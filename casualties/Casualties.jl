These winds lasted around an hour in total at any one location, even though the initial line of storms moved out quickly. Damaging straight-line winds continued and were associated with the rear inflow jet. Maximum wind speeds were estimated to be 80 to 100 MPH for much of the county, with areas in central Linn County that had wind speed estimates that were 120 MPH or higher. The highest estimated wind speed were in the Cedar Rapids area where extensive damage to an apartment complex occurred with damage indicating winds about 140 MPH. A radio transmission tower also collapsed with wind speed estimated at 130 MPH. These estimates were determined based off damage reports and photos submitted through social media as well as a damage survey. The peak thunderstorm wind gust measured at the Cedar Rapids airport ASOS before it lost power was 68 MPH. The duration of strong winds caused extensive damaged most if not all trees, crops, and structures in their path. Due to the widespread damage, long duration power outages occurred. One fatality occurred here when a 63 year old man riding a bicycle was struck and killed by a tree that was knocked down due to the winds. There were also numerous injuries reported in the Cedar Rapids area."

Seventeen people were taken to area hospitals and treated for their injuries. According to radar data and eye witness reports, outflow winds of 50 to 60 mph from the rear flank downdraft of the supercell thunderstorm arrived between 3:40 p.m. and 3:50 p.m. causing the localized damage near Busch Stadium."
