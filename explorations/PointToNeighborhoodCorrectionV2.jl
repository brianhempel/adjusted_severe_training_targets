# Compute a correction to convert ASOS point-based gustiness to 25mi neighborhood gustiness.
#
# Compare the point-based gustiness to the 25mi neighborhood gustiness for points
# with 1 to 10 ASOS stations within 25mi.
#
# As the number of nearby ASOS stations increases, the ratio between the point-based
# and the 25mi gustiness should approach an asymptope as the stations catch all the
# severe gusts...but instead it looks linear :o
